# NurseryIndoor-Final-Year-Project-
Nursery is a place where planting material, such as seedlings, saplings, cuttings, etc., are raised, propagated and multiplied under favorable conditions for transplanting in prepared beds. The availability of quality and true-to-type planting material is the prerequisite of successful and remunerative ornamental crop production. Setting up of a nursery is a long-term venture, and requires planning and expertise.
